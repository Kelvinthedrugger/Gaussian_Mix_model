project itself:

  run.sh: buggy, whether it's compiled, tho it should'n affect the result if you recomile the file everytime
          update: done

  params should be changed manually in poolornot.c file

  
  model inference: p.35 in textbook

  consider 2 models only, 
    P[s|F] = P[s|F, H0]P[H0] + P[s|F, H1]P[H1]

  which,
    P[H0|s, F] = P[s|F, H0] * P[H0] / P[s|F]

    P[H1|s, F] = P[s|F, H1] * P[H1] / P[s|F]
  
    s: sequence (aka result, e.g. head,head, tail) 
    F: count, e.g. Fhead = 2
    Hi, model i, e.g H0: model 0

  using ratio of posterior, we're able to observe which model is more likely to generate observed the data

  gaussian mixture model: 
    ch 22, maximum likelihood, Page302
    ch 3, posterior prob. ratio, 

  code:
    cdfInv_precompute():
      do the sample of prior distri. and store in cdfInv_xx
      , which would be used in data_prob_xx_by_Summming()
      to produce data that would lead to posterior prob.

    data_prob_xx_bySampling(): 
      return data by running normal gaussian(s) 


    flow: assign prior_mu, prior_sigma_params,
       -> use these in cdfInv_precompute()
       -> in main():
            generate data
            loop
              sample data and calculate posterior prob
              by summing and sampling
              compare to see if success
  
  report:
    put this in: 
      It was not fully understood by me until I
    dig into every line of the code and try to re-create 
    the program from scratch. Especially the part that 
    utilized conjugate prior in order to produce data in 
    generating-data-by-summing" step, which is required 
    before we can experimenting inference problem, 
    is a thinker to me. 
      Huge thanks to professor whether I got the content 
    of this report right. Without this homework, I might
    need 10x of work to implement inference problem in 
    future, especially when a knowledge in details
    is essential.

project itself:

    run.sh: buggy, whether it's compiled, tho it should'n affect the result if you recomile the file everytime
            update: done

    params should be changed manually in poolornot.c file


// not working, since this git repo is init by professor
// stop wasting the time
account setting:
1. add this git repo remotely to my github

2. figure out how to do 2 git acc & 1 github acc

3. set user name on wsl2 (here): done

4. push the repo so that i don't have to worry about file loss

5. should probably mv results.txt into the git repo since it's probably the most important thing

project itself:

  run.sh: buggy, whether it's compiled, tho it should'n affect the result if you recomile the file everytime
          update: done

  params should be changed manually in poolornot.c file

  
  model inference: p.35 in textbook

  consider 2 models only, 
    P[s|F] = P[s|F, H0]P[H0] + P[s|F, H1]P[H1]

  which,
    P[H0|s, F] = P[s|F, H0] * P[H0] / P[s|F]

    P[H1|s, F] = P[s|F, H1] * P[H1] / P[s|F]
  
    s: sequence (aka result, e.g. head,head, tail) 
    F: count, e.g. Fhead = 2
    Hi, model i, e.g H0: model 0

  using ratio of posterior, we're able to observe which model is more likely to generate observed the data
